steps to use redux as state management lib:
----------------------------------------------------------------


step-1 : know/identify UI appln's state

            e.g

            - products
            - recommendation
            - reviews
            - orders
            - currentUser
            - promotions
            - cart

step-2 : know/identify actions which cause state change


            - LOAD_PRODUCTS
            - LOAD_REVIEWS
            - ADD_NEW_REVIEW
            - DELETE_REVIEW
            - BUY


step-3 : create function(s) who can creation action objects a.k.a  action-creators 

            - { type , payload }


step-4 : create reducer(s) to process action, to make new-state
step-5 : compine multiple reducers as one root reducer

        imp-note : reducer must be pure function

step-6 : create store with root reducer
